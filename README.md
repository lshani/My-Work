# Coding
In 9th grade, I started learning to code. I took a course where I learned the basics of coding. I started off with blocks but as I picked up on patterns, I transitioned to writing in Javascript which I found much more flexible and quick. I feel that the projects I did in this course really helped me when I started AP CSP as I was able to make much more complex apps and games as my teacher would point out to me. I really enjoyed learning to code and is definitely something I would consider learning further in the future. This page contains several projects both from my course, AP CSP, and ones I did in my spare time. Since these are all on external apps or websites, I put the links to them below.
