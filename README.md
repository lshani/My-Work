# 3D-Modeling
A few years ago, I decided to take a 3D modeling and printing course which gave me a small 3D printer of my own. Since then, I became deeply invested in not only 3D modeling (which I taugh myself how to do prior to the course) but also printing my creations. I recently switched computers and unfortunately my software and work did not transfer over. I included here pictures that I had taken before I switched computers but I unfortunately could not find all of my work.
